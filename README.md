# MovieRecommender
This is a playground to apply and try out various approaches for recommender systems based on the publicly available movielens dataset (https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/) 

Some of the approaches are inspired by the talk of Daniel Pyrathon at PyCon2018: "A practical guide to SVD"

## Possible techniques to try out:
- Simple Collaborative Filtering (CF) approaches based on weighted similarities
- SVD approach
- Graph based approaches
- ...
