# MovieRecommender
This is a playground to apply and try out various approaches for recommender systems based on the publicly available MovieLens dataset (https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/) 


A sample (first 100K rows) of the MovieLens dataset "MovieLens 25M Dataset" is provided.

The EDA is based on a sample of the "MovieLens 25M Dataset"

The SVD approach is applied on the smaller "MovieLens 100K Dataset (09/2018)" to handle the size of the utility matrix


## Possible techniques to try out:
- Simple Collaborative Filtering (CF) approaches based on weighted similarities
- SVD approach
- Graph based approaches
- ...
